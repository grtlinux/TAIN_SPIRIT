	Apache Commons Net library implements the client side of many basic internet protocols.
	The purpose of the library is to provide fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions.
	Therefore, some of the design violates object-oriented design principles.
	Our philosophy is to make the global functionality of a protocol accessible (e.g.,TFTP send file and receive file)
	when possible, but also provide access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so that the programmer
	may construct his own custom implementations.
